I'm Justin Michel, Team-oriented and self-motivated software engineer and javascript expert with 8 years of experience. My approach to the solution is not just implement the logic but make sure it's maintainable and scalable in the further future.
Usually work in the day and sometimes, eager to contribute something or anything to this open source world. 
Currently working on a self-employed project for the next generation of a dating app - Bump
